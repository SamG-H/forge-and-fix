<h1 class="is-size-1 has-text-info">Welcome To Forge And Fix!</h1>
<p class="is-size-3">This is a place for people to share ideas and work on projects together.</p>
<h2 class="is-size-2 has-text-link">How It Works</h2>
<p class="is-size-3">Sign up for an account, create projects, add issues(bugs/features), and assign tasks to yourself.</p>
<h2 class="is-size-2 has-text-success">Note</h2>
<p class="is-size-3">You can view all of the projects, issues, and tasks, but you must sign in to submit issues, create projects, and assign tasks. You can only edit and delete the projects you have created, the issues on your projects, and tasks you yourself have created.</p>
